      Welcome to the computer assisted article writing tool. This is an automated article writer for teachers
      who want to create texts to reinforce topics/vocabulary,
      and for students who want to practice their language skils by reading about topics that interest them.<br>
      Just choose a genre from the list below, enter your topic of choice and hit submit.<br>
      <!--If you wish to focus on certain vocabulary you can put in a list of words that must be in the text-->
      You can also optionally add TOEFL style comprehension questions by checking the box below<br>
      See the <a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">About</a> page for further information.
          <div id="myDIV">
            <p class = myDIV>
          Please wait for about 20 seconds, longer if you requested questions</p>
          </div>

                <!--<form  onsubmit="waiting_message()" action="/articles" method = "POST" >-->
                <!--    <p>Article <input type = "text" name = "Article" placeholder = "Enter your topic" /></p>-->
                <!--    <p>Dialog <input type = "text" name = "Dialog" placeholder = "Enter your topic" /></p>-->

      <form onsubmit="waiting_message()" action="/articles" method = "POST">
           <input type="radio" value="Article" name="genre">
           <label for="Article">Article</label><br>
           <input type="radio" value="Dialog" name="genre">
          <label for="Dialog">Dialog</label><br>
           <input type="radio" value="Poem" name="genre">
